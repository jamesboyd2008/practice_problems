There are 3 test cases included in the directory:

one.txt
two.txt
loneliestNumber.txt

In all the test cases, the names of the players are
listed in reverse order, with Alice in the first position.

Test Cases:

  1. This is the test case from the assignment,
     to see if the program works, because I'm too lazy to write my own
     test case.

  2. This is a more realistic rhyme for this game with the maximum player
     count. Often, things will break when pushed to their extremes.

  3. This test case checks whether Alice is trying to play by herself.
