        <ul>
          <li>Where will you be going in these shoes?</li>
          <li>How much durabilitly do you seek from this shoe?</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Buying shoes online can prove to be a swing-and-miss situation.  There are more options available online, but you can't try on the shoes without paying to have them shipped to your location.  Some online retailers offer a full refund if you don't like the shoe after buying it, or if it doesn't fit.  Some of these retailers would gladly send you some different shoes, or some different sizes of the shoe you want.  Shoot, maybe you could buy the shoe you want in three different sizes, and then send back all the ones that don't fit, but that could be expensive.</p>
    <p>However, many shoppers do not have time to buy shoes, thusly.  I would venture to guess that most shoppers are looking for a one-stop-shop.</p>
