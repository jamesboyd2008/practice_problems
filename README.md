# Practice Problems

To run a C++ program from this repo:  
1. Pull it down.  
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory in the command line.  
  2.1 Install g++ (or the xcode command line tools) if you have not already done so.  
    2.1.1 Verify successful installation with the command `$ g++ -v`  
3. `$ g++ <name_of_file.cpp> -o <name_your_executable_file_here>`  
4. `$ ./<the_executable_file>`  
  You can, sometimes, combine the above two commands thusly:  
    `$ g++ <c_plus_plus_file.cpp> -o <executable_file> && ./<executable_file>`
