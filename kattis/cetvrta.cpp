/*
This program turns a right triangle into a rectangle.

This puzzle is from https://open.kattis.com/problems/cetvrta

Title: Cetvrta
Mirko needs to choose four points in the plane so that they form a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes. He has already chosen three points and is confident that he hasnâ€™t made a mistake, but is having trouble locating the last point. Help him.

Input
Each of the three points already chosen will be given on a separate line. All coordinates will be integers between 1 and 1000.

Output
Output the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the rectangle.

Sample Input 1	Sample Output 1
5 5             7 7
5 7
7 5

Sample Input 2	Sample Output 2
30 20           30 10
10 10
10 20
