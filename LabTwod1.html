    <h2>Descriptions</h2>


    <h3>1-Mall Services</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">Mall Services deals with the day-to-day management of the Mall.  Mainly this involves leasing space in the Mall, collecting rent payments for occupied space, and making the Mall’s mortgage payments.  Mall Services is responsible for preparing a department budget and for producing a collective budget for the Business Services Division.</p>

    <h3>2-Personnel Services</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">The main focus of Personnel Services is to process the payroll for all the people that work in the Mall.  This includes collecting time sheets, producing paychecks and dealing with employee benefits. The individual stores hire their own employees and set the pay rates.  However, each store or Mall employee submits a bimonthly time sheet to Personnel Services where all the records (such as hours worked, overtime hours, sick leave and vacation time) are kept.  Stores pay a small fee for this service.  Becky Mitchell, Brad Lawrence and Mike King (manager) work for Personnel Services.</p>

    <h3>3-Marketing Services</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">Marketing Services’ major function is advertising.  This includes preparing Mall-wide ad campaigns, for which each store is charged a fee, and helping stores do individual advertisements.  Marketing Services keeps track of all advertising costs, and processes all contacts with radio, TV and print media.  Ray Garcia, April Mason and Joe Brown (manager) work for Marketing Services.</p>

    <p class="descriptions">Marketing Services also runs surveys on customer preferences and satisfaction.  In addition, Marketing Services gathers statistics on Mall traffic both for the overall Mall and for individual stores.</p>

    <h3>4-Running Gear</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">Running Gear is a sporting goods store specializing in bicycle equipment (bikes and clothing), and running gear (running shoes and clothing).  Some swimwear is stocked for customers interested in triathlons.   As with any retail operation, the goal is to make a profit by selling items to customers.  This involves ordering the items, pricing the items, and selling them.  Also, since many of the store employees are part time workers, a weekly work schedule must be maintained.  The Running Gear’s employees report to the storeowner, JAG Sports, Inc.  Bill Dalton is the local manager.  Jacob Juarez, John Schmidt, Arlo Watson, and Lindsey Wong are sales employees.</p>

    <h3>5-Safety and Security</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">Mall Safety and Security has police responsibility for the Mall building and grounds.  The Safety and Security employees on patrol are licensed guards and have police powers.  They patrol the Mall buildings and grounds when the Mall is open, and make periodic checks when the Mall is closed.  This group manages all Mall locks and keys.  It also deals with issuing parking stickers (permits) to employees so they may park in the secure employee parking area.  Clint Westwood is the head of Safety and Security.  Mattie Dillion works in the department.</p>

    <h3>6-Healthful Health Foods</h3>

    <p class="descriptions">Healthful Health Foods specialized in organically grown foods, both fresh and packaged.  There is a produce department, a packaged foods and beverages department, and also a small lunch counter.  The lunch counter serves drinks and sandwiches.
